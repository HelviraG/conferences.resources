## Abstract:

```
Everyone knows this developer, who is super duper passionate about his job. 
You can easily recognize this developer because he/she spends hours coding, even outside of work; 
mastering tech watch like no one else; whose topics of conversation often revolve around code.

Even if we are passionate, we sometimes neither feel nor express this passion for the code. 
And easily, upon this developer's contact, unease can arise if we do not feel this passion.
And this, even if you are a developer yourself.

This discomfort can be a source of worry and doubt about one's skills.

Indeed, if the enthusiast devotes hours to personal projects, perhaps we should?

But then, do you have to be passionate to be a developer?
Does passion truly add value?

Wouldn't the injunction to passion in dev ultimately be a trap?

Is passion THE essential software for anyone wishing to code?

Here, is the whole purpose of this conference!

Bonus: If you like Vikings, this is for you!
