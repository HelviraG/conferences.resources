  <p style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; text-align: justify">
There is an increasingly prevalent expectation in contemporary society that employees be passionate for their work. Here, we suggest that employers and employees can have different understandings of passion that potentially conflict. More specifically, we argue that although employers may often be well-intentioned, their emphasis on employee passion may at times amount to normative control and reflect a means to attain valued work outcomes. In contrast, employees may primarily view their pursuit of passion as an opportunity to self-actualize, and thereby, view passion as an end in itself. We propose that when employees notice that these two understandings of passion diverge, they experience uncertainty in adjudicating which understanding of passion—their own or their employer’s—to privilege. Critically, employees may feel responsible for and subsequently seek ways to reduce this uncertainty, and doing so places added demands that impedes employees’ ability to perform. We discuss why employers may not necessarily recognize how their understanding of passion can create challenges for employees, and examine the difficulties employers face in attempting to resolve the tensions employees experience. Subsequently, we develop an agenda for future research that highlights how individual, organizational, and cultural differences may lead to variation in divergent understandings of passion, and the critical role managers could play in helping address employees’ uncertainty.  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; text-align: justify">
The pursuit of passion in one’s work is touted in contemporary discourse. Although passion may indeed
be beneficial in many ways, we suggest that the modern cultural emphasis may also serve to facilitate the
legitimization of unfair and demeaning management practices—a phenomenon we term the legitimization of passion exploitation. Across 7 studies and a meta-analysis, we show that people do in fact deem
poor worker treatment (e.g., asking employees to do demeaning tasks that are irrelevant to their job
description, asking employees to work extra hours without pay) as more legitimate when workers are
presumed to be “passionate” about their work. Of importance, we demonstrate 2 mediating mechanisms
by which this process of legitimization occurs: (a) assumptions that passionate workers would have
volunteered for this work if given the chance (Studies 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8), and (b) beliefs that, for passionate
workers, work itself is its own reward (Studies 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8). We also find support for the reverse
direction of the legitimization process, in which people attribute passion to an exploited (vs. nonexploited) worker (Study 7). Finally, and consistent with the notion that this process is connected to justice
motives, a test of moderated mediation shows this is most pronounced for participants high in belief in
a just world (Study 8). Taken together, these studies suggest that although passion may seem like a
positive attribute to assume in others, it can also license poor and exploitative worker treatment.  </p>

    Why are some people more skilled in complex domains than other people? According to one prominent view, individual differences in performance largely reflect individual differences in accumulated amount of deliberate practice. Here, we investigated the relationship between deliberate practice and performance in sports. Overall, deliberate practice accounted for 18% of the variance in sports performance. However, the contribution differed depending on skill level. Most important, deliberate practice accounted for only 1% of the variance in performance among elite-level performers. This finding is inconsistent with the claim that deliberate practice accounts for performance differences even among elite performers. Another major finding was that athletes who reached a high level of skill did not begin their sport earlier in childhood than lower skill athletes. This finding challenges the notion that higher skill performers tend to start in a sport at a younger age than lower skill performers. We conclude that to understand the underpinnings of expertise, researchers must investigate contributions of a broad range of factors, taking into account findings from diverse subdisciplines of psychology (e.g., cognitive psychology, personality psychology) and interdisciplinary areas of research (e.g., sports science).  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; text-align: justify">
Drawing on the array of literature on exploitation from several social science disciplines, we propose a new way of seeing employer–employee relationships by introducing the concept of perceived exploitative employee–organization relationships, distinguish it from related concepts, and conduct five studies to develop a scale and test our theoretical model of the effects of such employee perceptions. Contributing to the employee–organization relationships and workplace emotions literatures, perceived exploitation is defined as employees’ perceptions that they have been purposefully taken advantage of in their relationship with the organization, to the benefit of the organization itself. We propose and find that such perceptions are associated with both outward-focused emotions of anger and hostility toward the organization and inward-focused ones of shame and guilt at remaining in an exploitative job. In two studies including construction workers and a time-lagged study of medical residents, we find that the emotions of anger and hostility partially mediate the effects of perceived exploitation on employee engagement, revenge against the organization, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions, whereas the emotions of shame and guilt partially mediate the effects of perceived exploitation on employee burnout, silence, and psychological withdrawal.  <div style="margin-top: 40px"></div>

Using the Dualistic Model of Passion (Vallerand, On passion for life activities: The dualistic model of passion. In M. P. Zanna (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (Vol. 42, pp. 97–193). New York: Academic, 2010; The psychology of passion. New York, in press), I demonstrate that passion matters for the field of education. Passion is defined as a strong inclination for a self-defining activity that we love, value, and spend a considerable amount of time on. Two types of passion are proposed: a harmonious and an obsessive passion. Obsessive passion is involved when people feel that they can’t help themselves and surrender to their desire to engage in the passionate activity. It results from a controlled internalization (Ryan & Deci (2000). The “what” and “why” of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behavior. Psychological Inquiry, 11, 227–268) of the activity in the person’s identity. On the other hand, harmonious passion refers to a strong inclination for the activity that nevertheless remains under the person’s control. The person can choose when to and when not to engage in the activity. Harmonious passion results from an autonomous internalization of the activity in identity. I review research that reveals that harmonious passion for teaching is typically associated with adaptive outcomes, while obsessive passion is related to less adaptive and at times maladaptive outcomes. These findings have been obtained with respect to a number of affective, cognitive, mental, and physical health, relationships, and performance variables with diverse populations. These findings also apply for passion for one’s studies. I also address the role of personality and social variables in the development of passion. Finally, some directions for future research are proposed.  <div style="margin-top: 40px"></div>
