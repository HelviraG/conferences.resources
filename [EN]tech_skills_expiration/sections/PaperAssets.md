  <p style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; text-align: justify">
The Impostor Phenomenon (IP) is widely discussed in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and has been evaluated in Computer Science students. However, formal research on IP in software engineers has yet to be conducted, although its impacts may lead to mental disorders such as depression and burnout. This study describes a survey that investigates the extent of impostor feelings in software engineers, considering aspects such as gender, race/ethnicity, and roles. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of IP on their perceived productivity. The survey instrument was designed using a theory-driven approach and included demographic questions, an internationally validated IP scale, and questions for measuring perceived productivity based on the SPACE framework constructs. The survey was sent to companies operating in various business sectors. Data analysis used bootstrapping with resampling to calculate confidence intervals and Mann-Whitney statistical significance testing for assessing the hypotheses. We received responses from 624 software engineers from 26 countries. The bootstrapping results reveal that a proportion of 52.7% of software engineers experience frequent to intense levels of IP and that women suffer at a significantly higher proportion (60.6%) than men (48.8%). Regarding race/ethnicity, we observed more frequent impostor feelings in Asian (67.9%) and Black (65.1%) than in White (50.0%) software engineers. We also observed that the presence of IP is less common among individuals who are married and have children. Moreover, the prevalence of IP showed a statistically significant negative effect on the perceived productivity for all SPACE framework constructs. The evidence relating IP to software engineers provides a starting point to help organizations find ways to raise awareness of the problem and improve the emotional skills of software professionals.  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; text-align: justify">
Imposter syndrome is a psychological phenomenon that affects individuals who doubt their skills and abilities, despite possessing the necessary competencies. This can lead to a lack of confidence and poor performance. While research has explored the impacts of imposter syndrome on students and professionals in various fields, there is limited knowledge on how it affects code comprehension in software engineering. In this exploratory study, we investigate the prevalence of imposter syndrome among final-year undergraduate computer science students and its effects on their code comprehension cognition using an eye tracker and heart rate monitor. Key findings demonstrate that students identifying as male exhibit lower imposter syndrome levels when analyzing code, and higher imposter syndrome is associated with increased time reviewing a code snippet and a lower likelihood of solving it correctly. This study provides initial data on this topic and establishes a foundation for further research to support student academic success and improve developer productivity and mental well-being.  </p>

    This paper examines the role of lifelong learning in counteracting skill depreciation and obsolescence. We differentiate between occupations with more hard skills versus more soft skills and draw on representative job advertisement data that contain machine-learning categorized skill requirements and cover the Swiss job market in great detail across occupations (from 1950 to 2019). We examine lifelong learning effects for “harder” versus “softer” occupations, thereby analyzing the role of training in counteracting skill depreciation in occupations that are differently affected by skill depreciation. Our results reveal novel empirical patterns regarding the benefits of lifelong learning, which are consistent with theoretical explanations based on structurally different skill depreciation rates: In harder occupations, with large shares of fast-depreciating hard skills, the role of lifelong learning is primarily as a hedge against unemployment risks rather than a boost to wages. By contrast, in softer occupations, in which workers build on more value-stable soft-skill foundations, the role of lifelong learning instead lies mostly in acting as a boost for upward career mobility and leads to larger wage gains.  </p>

    This paper analyzes how computerization affected the labor market outcomes of older workers between 1984 and 2017. Using the computerization supplements of the Current Population Survey (CPS) we show that different occupations were computerized at different times, older workers tended to start using computers with a delay compared to younger workers, but computer use within occupations converged to the same levels across age groups eventually. That is, there was a temporary knowledge gap between younger and older workers in most occupations. Using this variation, we estimate how this knowledge gap affected older workers’ labor market outcomes using millions of observations from the CPS, and additional data from the Health and Retirement Study. Our models control for occupation and time fixed effects and in some models, we also control for full occupation-time interactions and use middle aged (age 40-49) workers as the control group. We find strong and robust negative effects of the knowledge gap on wages, and a large, temporary increase in transitions from work to non-participation. These results are consistent with a model of creative destruction in which the computerization of jobs made older workers’ skills obsolete in birth cohorts that experienced computerization relatively late in their careers. We find larger effects on females and on middle-skilled workers.  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; text-align: justify">
    The post‐pandemic era, coupled with the rising adoption of AI chatbots and robotics, introduces significant new challenges for employee work well‐being. Thus, it is important to investigate underlying mechanisms about how employees can develop mindsets to promote well‐being at work. This study examines how a dual‐focused growth mindset—comprising a growth mindset about the self (the belief in the ability to develop personal abilities) and a growth mindset about work (the belief in the capacity to optimise work conditions)—can enhance employee work well‐being through resilience. In a two‐wave survey involving 606 full‐time employees in China (Study 1), we found that both mindsets were associated with lower levels of mental ill‐health symptoms (one dimension of work well‐being) by increasing personal resilience. Notably, the effect of a growth mindset about the self (but not about work) on personal resilience was stronger when individuals perceived a high (vs. low) level of work stress. In Study 2, a quasi‐experimental design with 85 participants in an intervention group and 66 in a control group demonstrated that a growth mindset intervention effectively enhanced dual growth mindsets, leading to improved well‐being, including job satisfaction and individual flourishing. A serial mediation analysis confirmed that resilience mediated the relationship between the self‐growth mindset (not work‐growth mindset) and employee flourishing. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.  </p>

Impostorism denotes individuals who are successful in their jobs but who doubt their abilities relative to the demands of their jobs. This study analyzes to what extent impostorism affects leadership behavior of these individuals. A core component of leadership is task delegation, implying the empowerment of employees to take responsibility for more or less challenging projects. In a vignette study, N = 190 managers assigned both routine and challenging tasks to employees who allegedly possessed varying levels of self-confidence regarding their job-related abilities. Managers holding negative self-views of their own abilities and perceiving themselves as impostors in their jobs, preferred to delegate both challenging and routine tasks to employees whose self-views resembled those of the managers. This study clearly shows that managers' self-beliefs bias their task delegation decisions.  <div style="margin-top: 40px"></div>

  <p style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; text-align: justify">
In the Impostor Phenomenon (IP), people who are objectively competent and successful report feeling secretly inadequate and fear detection of their incompetence. The IP has typically been studied using personality scales, but recent research has raised concerns about conceptualizing the IP as a personality trait. In the present work we approached the IP instead as an affective experience that can arise in anyone in response to certain evocative situations. Undergraduates (N = 122) described experiences in which they felt like impostors. Qualitative and quantitative analyses showed impostor episodes to be widely experienced and related to certain situational factors such as the relative status of the perceiver. Additionally, IP personality scales are shown to predict some features of people's impostor experiences. Results are discussed in light of IP theory and research as well as self-verification theory.  <div style="margin-top: 40px"></div>

Background
<br />
The extent to which students view their intelligence as improvable (i.e., their “mindset”) influences students’ thoughts, behaviors, and ultimately their academic success. Thus, understanding the development of students’ mindsets is of great interest to education scholars working to understand and promote student success. Recent evidence suggests that students’ mindsets continue to develop and change during their first year of college. We built on this work by characterizing how mindsets change and identifying the factors that may be influencing this change among upper-level STEM students. We surveyed 875 students in an organic chemistry course at four points throughout the semester and interviewed a subset of students about their mindsets and academic experiences.
<br />
Results
<br />
Latent growth modeling revealed that students tended to shift towards viewing intelligence as a stable trait (i.e., shifted towards a stronger fixed mindset and a weaker growth mindset). This trend was particularly strong for students who persistently struggled in the course. From qualitative analysis of students’ written survey responses and interview transcripts, we determined that students attribute their beliefs about intelligence to five factors: academic experiences, observing peers, deducing logically, taking societal cues, and formal learning.
<br />
Conclusions
<br />
Extensive prior research has focused on the influence of mindset on academic performance. Our results corroborate this relationship and further suggest that academic performance influences students’ mindsets. Thus, our results imply that mindset and academic performance constitute a positive feedback loop. Additionally, we identified factors that influence undergraduates’ mindset beliefs, which could be leveraged by researchers and practitioners to design more persuasive and effective mindset interventions to promote student success.  <div style="margin-top: 40px"></div>

Generative AI technologies promise to transform the product development lifecycle. This study evaluates the efficiency gains, areas for improvement, and emerging challenges of using GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant. We identified 15 software development tasks and assessed Copilot's benefits through real-world projects on large proprietary code bases. Our findings indicate significant reductions in developer toil, with up to 50% time saved in code documentation and autocompletion, and 30-40% in repetitive coding tasks, unit test generation, debugging, and pair programming. However, Copilot struggles with complex tasks, large functions, multiple files, and proprietary contexts, particularly with C/C++ code. We project a 33-36% time reduction for coding-related tasks in a cloud-first software development lifecycle. This study aims to quantify productivity improvements, identify underperforming scenarios, examine practical benefits and challenges, investigate performance variations across programming languages, and discuss emerging issues related to code quality, security, and developer experience.  <div style="margin-top: 40px"></div>

Unlike other professions, where knowledge and skills become obsolete more slowly, it is estimated that an IT professional will become obsolete in two years. Thus, the accurate assessment of technical skills can help software engineers to take the necessary actions to mitigate the risk of professional obsolescence. This work proposes a method to assess the degree of professional obsolescence, based on the concept of Participatory Sensing Network. To evaluate the proposed method, we collected data from 50 software engineers, and presented it to 9 professional recruiters to reach a measure of their actual employability. Then, we compared these data against the calculations of our algorithm. The results showed no significant difference between the traditional recruitment process and the proposed algorithm, which means that the algorithm can be an accurate surrogate for such employability assessment.   <div style="margin-top: 40px"></div>
